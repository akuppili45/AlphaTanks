# Implimentation
This was a team project implimented using java libraries and data structures. We represented states as Enums and used Stacks to store bullets and powerups. All the code uses objected oriented programming with best practices and code documentation. There are extensive test written for every class in order to show TTD( Test Driven Development). 

The project was designed and sharpened over several weeks until the implimentation state. We surveyed users in order to verify our idea was correct and recieved a very positive response. 

After demoing the game at our school, students praised it and loved the game.
